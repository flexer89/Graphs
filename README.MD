# Directed and Undirected Graphs

A graph is an abstract model used to represent relationships between objects. Graphs consist of vertices (also known as nodes) and edges that connect vertices. Graphs can be directed or undirected.

## Directed Graphs

A directed graph is a graph in which each edge has a specific direction. An edge connects two vertices, one of which is the source and the other is the target. An example of a directed graph can be a road network, where vertices represent intersections and edges represent roads.

## Undirected Graphs

An undirected graph is a graph in which edges do not have a specific direction. An edge connects two vertices, and it does not matter which vertex is the starting point and which is the endpoint. An example of an undirected graph can be a social network, where vertices represent people and edges represent relationships between them.

## Representing Graphs

Graphs can be represented in various ways. One of the most popular ways is the adjacency matrix, where the (i, j) element in the matrix indicates whether there is an edge between vertices i and j. In a directed graph, the matrix is symmetric with respect to the main diagonal, and the values in the elements represent the direction of the edge.

## Graph Algorithms

Directed and undirected graphs are used in many fields, such as computer science, mathematics, and physics. There are many algorithms that allow efficient traversal of graphs and finding the shortest paths or cycles. Examples of such algorithms include:
- DFS (Depth-First Search),
- BFS (Breadth-First Search),
- Dijkstra's algorithm,
- Floyd-Warshall algorithm
